# OmniConf

OmniConf is a conference web site project that supports multiple instances of a given conference (e.g. annual conferences that want to show past events' speakers, etc.). It is built on ASP.NET 5 and supports the display of:

* Speakers
* Sessions
* Sponsors

It also will support an API for use by mobile clients and some simple, specialized content management capabilities for managing the site's main pages.
